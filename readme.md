## IPv6 Memory Allocation and Manipulation Exploit PoC
- This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an IPv6 memory allocation and manipulation exploit. It demonstrates how vulnerabilities in the handling of IPv6 packets, particularly related to memory allocation and integer underflows, can be exploited.

## IPv6 Packet Crafting
- The script allocates memory for IPv6 packets and carefully crafts payloads designed to exploit known vulnerabilities. By manipulating packet headers and payload data, it targets specific weaknesses, potentially leading to memory corruption or other unintended behaviors.

## Specially Crafted Fragments
- Functions within the script create IPv6 fragments tailored to trigger vulnerabilities in packet handling, further supporting the testing and demonstration of these weaknesses.

## Dynamic Payload Generation
- The script dynamically generates payloads and adapts them based on target responses (using the autoevade option). This mimics real-world exploitation techniques where payloads are refined based on feedback from the target system.

## Command Injection
-  The autorce option allows the injection of command payloads into the crafted packets, simulating an attackerâ€™s attempt to execute commands on a vulnerable system.

## Denial-of-Service (DoS)
- The script includes functionality to create flooding attacks, overwhelming the target with traffic to disrupt its operations.

## Memory Corruption Testing
- It also provides mechanisms to create memory corruption, testing how the target system responds to deliberately malformed packets.

## Low-Level Operations
- The use of C code within perl allows for low-level socket operations and direct manipulation of memory, ensuring precise control over packet creation and timing, which is crucial for exploit development and testing which is not posible from Perl or Python and other languages.
