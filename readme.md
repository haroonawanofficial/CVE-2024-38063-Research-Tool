# CVE-2024-38063 Research Tool

This repository contains a powerful and adaptive tool designed for researching the CVE-2024-38063 vulnerability. Unfortunately, I discovered that this CVE is theoretical and not practical, so an integer underflow will never occur. Sad news! However, the tool is still capable of dynamically generating payloads, leveraging integer underflow techniques, and performing research in real-time.
