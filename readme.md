## IPv6 Memory Allocation and Manipulation Exploit PoC
- This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an IPv6 memory allocation and manipulation exploit. It demonstrates how vulnerabilities in the handling of IPv6 packets, particularly related to memory allocation and integer underflows, can be exploited.

## IPv6 Packet Crafting
- The script allocates memory for IPv6 packets and carefully crafts payloads designed to exploit known vulnerabilities. By manipulating packet headers and payload data, it targets specific weaknesses, potentially leading to memory corruption or other unintended behaviors.

## Specially Crafted Fragments
- Functions within the script create IPv6 fragments tailored to trigger vulnerabilities in packet handling, further supporting the testing and demonstration of these weaknesses.

## Dynamic Payload Generation
- The script dynamically generates payloads and adapts them based on target responses (using the autoevade option). This mimics real-world exploitation techniques where payloads are refined based on feedback from the target system.

## Command Injection
-  The autorce option allows the injection of command payloads into the crafted packets, simulating an attackerâ€™s attempt to execute commands on a vulnerable system.

## Denial-of-Service (DoS)
- The script includes functionality to create flooding attacks, overwhelming the target with traffic to disrupt its operations.

## Memory Corruption Testing
- It also provides mechanisms to create memory corruption, testing how the target system responds to deliberately malformed packets.

## Low-Level Operations
- The use of C code within perl allows for low-level socket operations and direct manipulation of memory, ensuring precise control over packet creation and timing, which is crucial for exploit development and testing which is not posible from Perl or Python and other languages.

## Script Options
- The script provides various options for customization and control during exploitation:
```bash
--target <target_ip>: Specifies the target IPv6 address.
--header_length <length>: Sets the header length for packet crafting.
--exploit: Initiates the exploitation process.
--attempts <number>: Defines the number of exploit attempts (default is 1000).
--autoevade: Enables adaptive changes to payloads based on target responses.
--flood: Initiates a flooding attack for a specified duration.
--duration <seconds>: Sets the duration for the flooding attack (default is 60 seconds).
--autodos: Activates an automated denial-of-service attack.
--memcorrupt: Triggers memory corruption simulation.
--autorce: Enables command injection within the payload.
--payload <command>: Specifies the command to inject when using --autorce.
--no-ipv6-verify: Skips IPv6 validation checks.
--interface <interface>: Specifies the network interface to use.
--autointerface: Automatically detects the network interface when using a link-local address.
--help: Displays the usage information and exits.
```

This script can tempered for highly customizable attack.
